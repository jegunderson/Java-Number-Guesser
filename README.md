# Overview

<!-- {Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.} -->
I am trying to branch out and learn more software languages. I wanted to be able to have a firm grasp on java inlcuding recieving input from the user as well as printing back out to them, creating and writing to a file, as well as basic logic.

<!-- {Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.} -->
This program prompts the user for a max value then creates a number between 0 and that number and continues prompting until the user guesses the correcet number. It then creates a file and writes to it the list of numbers guessed and how many guesses it took.
<!-- {Describe your purpose for writing this software.} -->
I wanted to learn another programming language and decided this would be a good exercise for my first exposure to java.

<!-- {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.} -->
